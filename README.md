# GetLazarusOutOfThePitGame
A single player puzzle game where the objective is to save the character Lazarus from being crushed by boxes. A random box will appear on the bottom left hand corner of the screen and that box after a few seconds will drop at Lazarus' previous location. Each box has different weight and any box with higher weight that drops on a box with lower weight will keep crushing the box under until the falling box hits a box with higher or same weight. Lazarus can only move up and down one box height or side to side if the heights are the same. The objective of the game is to stack the boxes so Lazarus can get to the stop button.
